<h1>The Best Movies According to Adam</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>Quite possibly my favorite of all time. Amazing story that uses incredibly simple VFX and subverts tropes.</p>
<h3>Calvary</h3>
<p>A wonderful alagory of the Christian faith.</p>
<h3>The Skeleton Twins</h3>
<p>Bill Hader unlike anything you've seen him in and Kristin Wiig as twins. Addresses depression and family.</p>
